## Getting started

Before you begin, please consider a deeper look into the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html) and get familiar with some of the fundamental conventions that make Rust such a pleasure to develop with.

In case you are new to Rust, great resources for beginners can be found here:
- [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/)
- [Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)

## About Pull Requests

- Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.  
- Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.  
- Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.  

### Self review
You should always review your own PR first. To make everyone's lifes easier, write tests and be thorough about it as this pays off rather sooner than later.

### Suggested changes
We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. This is not meant to be rude, but just a way of making sure we can keep the bar high and improve the codebase with each PR merged.
